## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
There are two ways to run the attached Project scripts.
<br>
1. Locally 
- You should have Spark installed on your machine
- Python and PySpark API must installed as well
- Set up all Environment Variables correctly

2. In the Cloud (easier way)
- You shold have an Amazon AWS account (All other requirements are handled by AWS)


## Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
Sparkify is an imaginary music streaming company with thousands of users which generate vast amounts of data.<br>
The data is difficult to analyze on a single machine, due to its volume size.<br>
Therefore a Big Data tool such as Spark is needed to analyze this data.<br>
The goal is to use the customer data to predict customer Churn.<br>

The Project code is inside the .ipynb Notebook.<br>
The Notebook consistist of following parts:

- Module import and Module installation
- PySpark session creation
- Data Import
- Data Cleaning
- Data Aggregation and preparation
- Classification algorithms are used predict customer Churn
- Results are evaluated based on common metrics
